## Backbone
Complete the `pondView.js` file to create a Backbone view with the following features:

* [ ] Display a table row for each item.
* [ ] Display two columns, the name of the fish and the image for the fish. (The `image` attribute is the source URL.)
* [ ] Set up event bindings in the view such that when you change a modelâ€™s `name` attribute using `set`, the UI reflects the new name. (*NOTE* You don't need to have a UI to easily allow for name chaning. Just set up the event bindings such that it would happen. If you'd like to be able to test whether it's working, the pondView and myPond variables are available to you in the console).
